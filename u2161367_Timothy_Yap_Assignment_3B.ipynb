    "plays a central role in mathematical finance. This equation describes what is known as [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion).  $S(t)$ is taken to be positive and represents the value of a stock at time $t$. The deterministic ODE $\\dot S(t) = \\mu S(t)$, describes exponential growth in the value of a stock. We consider $\\mu > 0$ and refer to $\\mu$ as the growth rate. The term $\\sigma S(t) \\xi(t)$ describes fluctuations in the value of a stock. $\\xi(t)$ is a Gaussian random variable. The parameter $\\sigma > 0$ is known as the volatility. Notice that the fluctuating term contains $S(t)$ itself. This models the fact that fluctuations in a stock price are proportional to the price.\n",

    "The first figure shows us the numerical simulations for over 100 paths of the stochastic differential equation for Geometric Brownian Motion given above. With the set parameters, our graphs do seem to follow an upward trend which is expected as our $\\mu$ is stated to be 0.05; which is equivalent to a 5% annual growth. We can also observe the noise of the many different walks, this is due to the 0.2 set for our $\\sigma$.\n",

As more time passes, the standard deviation increases which is also expected as the longer out into the future we are simulating, the harder it becomes to predict the prices, hence the standard deviation becomes larger. The blue graph is the mean of all 2000 walks and this is also expected to have a slight upward gradient as before, the $\\mu$ is stated to be 0.05; which is equivalent to a 5% annual growth.\n",
